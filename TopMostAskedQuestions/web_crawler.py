Design Google's web crawler.
"""

"""
Google's web crawler is a large-scale distributed system that crawls the web to discover and index new web pages. The crawler is constantly running, and it visits billions of web pages every day.

Here is a high-level design for Google's web crawler:

1.Seed URLs: The crawler starts by crawling a set of seed URLs. These seed URLs can be manually specified, or they can be discovered from other sources, such as Google's search engine results pages (SERPs).

2. URL discovery: The crawler extracts new URLs from the web pages that it crawls. This can be done by parsing the HTML code of the web pages, or by following links on the web pages.

3. URL scheduling: The crawler maintains a queue of URLs to be crawled. The crawler schedules the URLs in the queue in a way that optimizes the crawling process.

4. Page fetching: The crawler fetches the web pages from the queue. This is done by sending HTTP requests to the web servers that host the web pages.

5. Page parsing: The crawler parses the HTML code of the web pages that it fetches. This is done to extract the content of the web pages, as well as the new URLs that are discovered on the web pages.

6. Indexing: The crawler indexes the content of the web pages. This is done to make the content searchable by Google's search engine.

The following code shows an example of a simple web crawler implemented in Python:
"""

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

class WebCrawler:
  def __init__(self):
    self.queue = []
    self.visited = set()

  def crawl(self, url):
    """Crawls the given URL and adds new URLs to the queue."""

    if url in self.visited:
      return

    self.visited.add(url)

    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")

    # Extract new URLs from the web page.
    for link in soup.find_all("a"):
      href = link.get("href")
      if href is not None and href.startswith("http"):
        self.queue.append(href)

  def start(self):
    """Starts crawling the web."""

    while True:
      if len(self.queue) == 0:
        break

      url = self.queue.pop(0)
      self.crawl(url)

# Example usage:

web_crawler = WebCrawler()

# Add a seed URL to the queue.
web_crawler.queue.append("https://www.google.com/")

# Start crawling the web.
web_crawler.start()

"""
This is just a simple example, and there are many other ways to implement a web crawler. The specific design that you choose will depend on your specific needs and requirements.

Here are some additional considerations for designing Google's web crawler:

1. Scalability: The web crawler needs to be able to handle a large number of URLs and pages.
2. Efficiency: The web crawler needs to be able to crawl the web efficiently.
3. Robustness: The web crawler needs to be able to handle errors and failures.
4. Politeness: The web crawler needs to be polite to the web servers that it crawls.
