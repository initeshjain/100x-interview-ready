"""
Write a program to complete an incomplete 9x9 Sudoku frame accurately.

There are a number of ways to solve a Sudoku puzzle. One common approach is to use a backtracking algorithm. The following Python code shows how to do this:
"""

def solve_sudoku(board):
  """Solves a Sudoku puzzle using backtracking.

  Args:
    board: A 9x9 Sudoku board.

  Returns:
    True if the puzzle was solved, False otherwise.
  """

  for i in range(9):
    for j in range(9):
      if board[i][j] == 0:
        for digit in range(1, 10):
          if is_valid_sudoku_move(board, i, j, digit):
            board[i][j] = digit
            if solve_sudoku(board):
              return True
            else:
              board[i][j] = 0

  return False

# Example usage:

board = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
