"""
Design an API rate limiter.
"""

"""
To design an API rate limiter, you need to consider the following factors:

Rate limits: What are the maximum number of requests that a client can make per second, minute, hour, or day?

Time window: Over what period of time are the rate limits applied?

Scope: Do the rate limits apply to all clients, or to specific clients or groups of clients?

Algorithm: How will the rate limiter track and enforce the rate limits?

One common algorithm for implementing an API rate limiter is the token bucket algorithm. In this algorithm, each client is assigned a bucket of tokens. When a client makes a request, it consumes one token from its bucket. If the client's bucket is empty, the request is rejected.

The rate limiter periodically refills the buckets of all clients. The rate at which the buckets are refilled determines the rate limits.

Here is a high-level design for an API rate limiter using the token bucket algorithm:

1. Store a bucket of tokens for each client.
2. When a client makes a request, consume one token from its bucket.
3. If the client's bucket is empty, reject the request.
4. Periodically refill the buckets of all clients.


The following code shows an example of a simple API rate limiter implemented in Python:
"""

class RateLimiter:
  def __init__(self, max_requests_per_second=100):
    self.max_requests_per_second = max_requests_per_second
    self.buckets = {}

  def allow_request(self, client_id):
    """Returns True if the client is allowed to make a request, False otherwise."""

    if client_id not in self.buckets:
      self.buckets[client_id] = []

    bucket = self.buckets[client_id]

    if len(bucket) >= self.max_requests_per_second:
      return False

    bucket.append(time.time())
    return True

  def refill_buckets(self):
    """Refills the buckets of all clients."""

    for client_id in self.buckets:
      bucket = self.buckets[client_id]

      while len(bucket) > 0 and bucket[0] < time.time() - 1:
        bucket.pop(0)


# Example usage:
rate_limiter = RateLimiter()

if rate_limiter.allow_request("client_id"):
  # Make the request
  pass
else:
  # The request was rejected
  pass


"""
This is just a simple example, and there are many other ways to implement an API rate limiter. The specific design that you choose will depend on your specific needs and requirements.
