Design a proximity server.

"""
A proximity server is a server that provides information or services to users based on their geographic location. Proximity servers are used in a variety of applications, such as location-based search engines, navigation apps, and social media apps.

Here is a high-level design for a proximity server:

1. Collect user locations. The proximity server can collect user locations in a variety of ways, such as through GPS, IP address, or cell tower triangulation.

2. Index user locations. The proximity server indexes the user locations in a spatial data structure, such as a quadtree or a geohash.

3. Respond to user requests. When a user makes a request, the proximity server searches the spatial data structure to find the users who are closest to the user's location. The proximity server then returns the results to the user.

The following code shows an example of a simple proximity server implemented in Python:

"""

import geohash

class ProximityServer:
  def __init__(self):
    self.user_locations = {}

  def add_user_location(self, user_id, latitude, longitude):
    """Adds a user location to the proximity server."""

    geohash = geohash.encode(latitude, longitude)
    self.user_locations[user_id] = geohash

  def find_nearby_users(self, user_id, radius_in_meters):
    """Finds all users who are within the given radius of the given user."""

    geohash = self.user_locations[user_id]
    nearby_geohashes = geohash.neighbors(radius_in_meters)

    nearby_users = []
    for geohash in nearby_geohashes:
      for user_id in self.user_locations:
        if self.user_locations[user_id] == geohash:
          nearby_users.append(user_id)

    return nearby_users

# Example usage:

proximity_server = ProximityServer()

# Add some user locations
proximity_server.add_user_location("user_1", 37.7833, -122.4167)
proximity_server.add_user_location("user_2", 37.7869, -122.4081)

# Find all users who are within 100 meters of user_1
nearby_users = proximity_server.find_nearby_users("user_1", 100)

# Print the results
for user_id in nearby_users:
  print(user_id)

"""
This is just a simple example, and there are many other ways to implement a proximity server. The specific design that you choose will depend on your specific needs and requirements.

Here are some additional considerations for designing a proximity server:

1. Scalability: The proximity server should be able to handle a large number of users and requests.
2. Accuracy: The proximity server should be able to accurately determine the locations of users.
3. Privacy: The proximity server should protect the privacy of users' locations.
